# ADCST

ADCST (Active Directory Contact Sync Tool) is a simple console application written in .NET that will connect to Azure Active Directory, enumerate users and then create Contact objects in an on-premises active directory (or delte them if required). 

This tool aims to solve an issue I am currently facing where two disparic companies need to exchange contact info for usage in Exchange Online.

...Its a work in progress
